            <h3>What is Cybernetics?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Cybernetics</strong> is the study of systems, communication, and control in living beings, machines, and organizations. The term comes from the Greek <em>kybernētēs</em> (“steersman” or “governor”) and was popularized in the 1940s by Norbert Wiener in his foundational book, <em>Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, cybernetics is about how systems use feedback to maintain stability, adapt to change, or achieve goals. This principle applies to thermostats and homeostasis in biology, to economic markets and social structures, and to artificial intelligence and robotics.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feedback:</strong> Circular processes in which a system regulates itself by monitoring its own output and making adjustments.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Homeostasis:</strong> The capacity of systems to maintain equilibrium through internal regulation.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Control:</strong> The ability of a system to influence its own state or environment to achieve objectives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Communication:</strong> The transmission of information within and between systems, essential for coordination and regulation.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Applications and Influence</h3>
            <p>
                Cybernetics has had a profound influence on fields as diverse as:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Biology:</strong> Explaining neural networks, genetic regulation, and ecosystems as feedback systems.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Engineering:</strong> Design of automatic control systems, robotics, and intelligent machines.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Mathematics & Computer Science:</strong> Foundations of information theory, computation, and artificial intelligence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sociology & Management:</strong> Organizational theory, systems thinking, and governance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Philosophy:</strong> Ideas on self-organization, autonomy, and the relationship between observer and observed.
                </li>
            </ul>
    
            <h3>Cybernetics in Today’s World</h3>
            <p>
                The cybernetic perspective remains remarkably relevant. In an era dominated by complex, interconnected systems — from ecological networks to smart infrastructure and learning algorithms — understanding the principles of feedback, adaptation, and control is more vital than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many concepts from cybernetics inspired contemporary areas such as systems biology, machine learning, and the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system">complex systems</a>. Even ethical issues like algorithmic bias and the limits of autonomous AI draw on cybernetic ideas about observation, reflexivity, and the boundaries of self-regulation.
