            <h3>What is Ambit Causality?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Ambit causality</strong> is a way to talk about cause and effect in <em>continuous</em> space–time stochastic fields. 
                Instead of discrete nodes and arrows (as in DAG-based causality), we work with <em>regions</em> and <em>supports</em>: measurable parts of space–time where randomness and modulation actually flow. 
                The key idea is that an ambit field’s geometry already encodes a causal structure — and this geometry yields a continuous analogue of a Markov blanket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider an ambit field
                <code>Y(x,t) = μ + ∫_{A(x,t)} g(x,ξ,t,s) σ(ξ,s) L(dξ ds) + Q(x,t)</code>, 
                where <em>A(x,t)</em> is the ambit set (the region that can influence <code>Y</code>), <em>L</em> is a Lévy basis (independently scattered noise), 
                <em>g</em> a deterministic kernel (propagator), <em>σ</em> a volatility field (modulation), and <em>Q</em> a drift/compensator. 
                With the usual causality constraint <code>A(x,t) ⊂ {s ≤ t}</code>, the field cannot depend on its future: acyclicity is baked in.
            </p>

            <h3>The Causal Ambit Blanket</h3>
            <p>
                For a fixed space–time point <code>(x,t)</code>, define the <strong>Causal Ambit Blanket</strong> (CAB) as the effective subset of the ambit set that transmits influence:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>B(x,t) := supp(g(x,·,t,·)) ∩ A(x,t)</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                To capture modulation and time deformation, augment it to
                <code>B*(x,t) := B(x,t) ∪ (supp(σ) ∩ A(x,t)) ∪ (supp(T) ∩ A(x,t))</code>,
                where <code>T</code> is a “metatime” (random clock) used in extended subordination. 
                Intuitively, <em>g</em> plays the role of “parents,” while <em>σ</em> and <em>T</em> route volatility or time-change — the “spouses/children” in the DAG analogy.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Conditional Independence</h3>
            <p>
                If the Lévy basis <em>L</em> is independently scattered and independent of any observation mechanism supported strictly outside <code>B*(x,t)</code>, 
                and if <em>σ</em> and <em>T</em> are predictable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by <code>L</code> on <code>B*(x,t)</code>, then we obtain a continuous Markov blanket property:
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>Y(x,t) ⟂ O | σ(L|_{B*(x,t)})</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In words: conditioning on the noise (and modulation) <em>inside</em> the blanket screens off everything outside. 
                This is the continuous counterpart of d-separation, expressed through regions rather than nodes.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ambit Set <code>A(x,t)</code>:</strong> The causal domain of influence. Often a past light-cone–like region in <code>ℝ^d × ℝ</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lévy Basis <code>L</code>:</strong> An independently scattered random measure that drives the field; disjoint regions carry independent noise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kernel <code>g</code>:</strong> A deterministic propagator that shapes how influence travels from <code>(ξ,s)</code> to <code>(x,t)</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Volatility <code>σ</code> and Metatime <code>T</code>:</strong> Amplitude and timing modulators that thicken the causal “shield.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>CAB <code>B(x,t)</code> and <code>B*(x,t)</code>:</strong> The minimal effective region that, when conditioned on, screens off outside influence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Predictability:</strong> Non-anticipativity with respect to the filtration generated by the restricted Lévy basis; ensures causal direction.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interventions on Regions</h3>
            <p>
                Ambit models make Pearl-style interventions natural by working directly on regions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Noise intervention:</strong> <code>L ⇒ L^{(do)}</code> on <code>R ⊂ B(x,t)</code> — change the Lévy triplet locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility intervention:</strong> <code>σ ⇒ σ^{(do)}</code> on <code>R ⊂ B*(x,t)</code> — alter amplitude modulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Clock/metatime intervention:</strong> <code>T ⇒ T^{(do)}</code> on <code>R ⊂ B*(x,t)</code> — deform the random clock.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This notion of intervention parallels the framework of <strong>Sokol &amp; Hansen (2013)</strong>, 
                who defined <em>post-intervention stochastic differential equations</em> to give a causal semantics to continuous-time systems. 
                Their approach interprets interventions as modifications of SDE coefficients (drift or diffusion), 
                showing that such interventions correspond to limits of discrete structural-equation models. 
                The <em>ambit causality</em> framework generalizes this idea spatially: interventions occur not only “in time” but on measurable <em>regions</em> of space–time where the field receives influence.
            </p>

            <h3>Multiscale “Triple-Integral” Blankets</h3>
            <p>
                Many systems add a third integration dimension, such as <em>scale</em> or <em>frequency</em>:
                <code>Y(x,t) = ∫_{s ≤ t} ∫_{‖ξ−x‖ ≤ c(t−s)} ∫_{0}^{∞} g(r) k(x,ξ,t,s;r) σ(ξ,s;r) L(dξ ds dr)</code>.
                The blanket now has a <em>thickness</em> in space–time–scale. 
                Conditioning on this triple layer (noise + volatility + scale) yields a multiscale causal shield.
            </p>

            <h3>Applications and Influence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Turbulence:</strong> Intermittency and energy cascades as multiscale blankets; interventions correspond to localized forcing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finance:</strong> Volatility-modulated Volterra processes; the blanket mirrors memory kernels and roughness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Neural/Spatial Fields:</strong> Continuous-time active inference; blankets define sensory–internal separations in cortex-like media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SPDEs:</strong> Green’s function supports give causal cones; CAB aligns with domains of dependence.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ambit Causality in Today’s World</h3>
            <p>
                The causal interpretation of SDEs developed by Sokol and Hansen (<em>Annals of Statistics</em>, 2013) 
                showed that stochastic systems can admit well-defined post-intervention dynamics without departing from the Itô–Lévy framework. 
                Ambit causality extends this insight to <em>spatially extended fields</em>: causation is encoded not in coefficients but in <em>regions</em> of space–time where noise and modulation propagate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As datasets become high-frequency and spatially distributed, a field-based causal language is essential. 
                Ambit causality offers a principled way to learn and manipulate <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> influence flows, 
                enabling region-level interventions in physics, quantitative finance, climate, and neuroscience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short: <em>instead of nodes and edges, we reason with regions and supports</em>. 
                Causality becomes geometry; stochastic integration becomes its calculus.
            </p>
