            <h3>What is Ambit Causality?</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Ambit causality</strong> is a way to talk about cause and effect in <em>continuous</em> space–time stochastic fields. 
                Instead of discrete nodes and arrows (as in DAG-based causality), we work with <em>regions</em> and <em>supports</em>: measurable parts of space–time where randomness and modulation actually flow. 
                The key idea is that an ambit field’s geometry already encodes a causal structure — and this geometry yields a continuous analogue of a Markov blanket.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consider an ambit field
                \[
                Y(x,t) = \mu + \int_{A(x,t)} g(x,\xi,t,s)\,\sigma(\xi,s)\,L(d\xi\,ds) + Q(x,t)
                \]
                where \(A(x,t)\) is the <em>ambit set</em> (the region that can influence \(Y\)), \(L\) is a Lévy basis (independently scattered noise), 
                \(g\) a deterministic kernel (propagator), \(\sigma\) a volatility field (modulation), and \(Q\) a drift/compensator. 
                With the usual causality constraint \(A(x,t) \subseteq \{ s \leq t \}\), the field cannot depend on its future: acyclicity is baked in.
            </p>

            <h3>The Causal Ambit Blanket</h3>
            <p>
                For a fixed space–time point \((x,t)\), define the <strong>Causal Ambit Blanket</strong> (CAB) as the effective subset of the ambit set that transmits influence:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                B(x,t) := \operatorname{supp}(g(x,\,\cdot,\,t,\,\cdot)) \cap A(x,t)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                To capture modulation and time deformation, augment it to
                \[
                B^*(x,t) :=\; B(x,t) \;\cup\; (\operatorname{supp}(\sigma) \cap A(x,t)) \;\cup\; (\operatorname{supp}(T) \cap A(x,t))
                \]
                where \(T\) is a “metatime” (random clock) used in extended subordination. 
                Intuitively, \(g\) plays the role of “parents,” while \(\sigma\) and \(T\) route volatility or time-change — the “spouses/children” in the DAG analogy.
            </p>

            <h3>Local Conditional Independence</h3>
            <p>
                If the Lévy basis \(L\) is independently scattered and independent of any observation mechanism supported strictly outside \(B^*(x,t)\),
                and if \(\sigma\) and \(T\) are predictable with respect to the \(\sigma\)-algebra generated by \(L\) on \(B^*(x,t)\), then we obtain a continuous Markov blanket property:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                Y(x,t)\; \perp\!\!\!\perp\; O\;\big|\, \sigma(L|_{B^*(x,t)})
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                In words: conditioning on the noise (and modulation) <em>inside</em> the blanket screens off everything outside. 
                This is the continuous counterpart of d-separation, expressed through regions rather than nodes.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Concepts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Ambit Set \(A(x,t)\):</strong> The causal domain of influence. Often a past light-cone–like region in \(\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lévy Basis \(L\):</strong> An independently scattered random measure that drives the field; disjoint regions carry independent noise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Kernel \(g\):</strong> A deterministic propagator that shapes how influence travels from \((\xi, s)\) to \((x, t)\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Volatility \(\sigma\) and Metatime \(T\):</strong> Amplitude and timing modulators that thicken the causal “shield.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>CAB \(B(x,t)\) and \(B^*(x,t)\):</strong> The minimal effective region that, when conditioned on, screens off outside influence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Predictability:</strong> Non-anticipativity with respect to the filtration generated by the restricted Lévy basis; ensures causal direction.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Interventions on Regions</h3>
            <p>
                Ambit models make Pearl-style interventions natural by working directly on regions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Noise intervention:</strong> \(L \Rightarrow L^{(\mathrm{do})}\) on \(R \subset B(x,t)\) — change the Lévy triplet locally.</li>
                <li><strong>Volatility intervention:</strong> \(\sigma \Rightarrow \sigma^{(\mathrm{do})}\) on \(R \subset B^*(x,t)\) — alter amplitude modulation.</li>
                <li><strong>Clock/metatime intervention:</strong> \(T \Rightarrow T^{(\mathrm{do})}\) on \(R \subset B^*(x,t)\) — deform the random clock.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This notion of intervention parallels the framework of <strong>Sokol &amp; Hansen (2013)</strong>, 
                who defined <em>post-intervention stochastic differential equations</em> to give a causal semantics to continuous-time systems. 
                Their approach interprets interventions as modifications of SDE coefficients (drift or diffusion), 
                showing that such interventions correspond to limits of discrete structural-equation models. 
                The <em>ambit causality</em> framework generalizes this idea spatially: interventions occur not only “in time” but on measurable <em>regions</em> of space–time where the field receives influence.
            </p>

            <h3>Multiscale “Triple-Integral” Blankets</h3>
            <p>
                Many systems add a third integration dimension, such as <em>scale</em> or <em>frequency</em>:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[
                Y(x,t) = \int_{s \leq t} \int_{\|\xi-x\| \leq c(t-s)} \int_{0}^\infty g(r)\,k(x,\xi,t,s;r)\,\sigma(\xi,s;r)\,L(d\xi\,ds\,dr)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                The blanket now has a <em>thickness</em> in space–time–scale. 
                Conditioning on this triple layer (noise + volatility + scale) yields a multiscale causal shield.
            </p>

            <h3>Applications and Influence</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Turbulence:</strong> Intermittency and energy cascades as multiscale blankets; interventions correspond to localized forcing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Finance:</strong> Volatility-modulated Volterra processes; the blanket mirrors memory kernels and roughness.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Neural/Spatial Fields:</strong> Continuous-time active inference; blankets define sensory–internal separations in cortex-like media.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>SPDEs:</strong> Green’s function supports give causal cones; CAB aligns with domains of dependence.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Ambit Causality in Today’s World</h3>
            <p>
                The causal interpretation of SDEs developed by Sokol and Hansen (<em>Annals of Statistics</em>, 2013) 
                showed that stochastic systems can admit well-defined post-intervention dynamics without departing from the Itô–Lévy framework. 
                Ambit causality extends this insight to <em>spatially extended fields</em>: causation is encoded not in coefficients but in <em>regions</em> of space–time where noise and modulation propagate.
            </p>
            <p>
                As datasets become high-frequency and spatially distributed, a field-based causal language is essential. 
                Ambit causality offers a principled way to learn and manipulate <em>where</em> and <em>how</em> influence flows, 
                enabling region-level interventions in physics, quantitative finance, climate, and neuroscience.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short: <em>instead of nodes and edges, we reason with regions and supports</em>. 
                Causality becomes geometry; stochastic integration becomes its calculus.
            </p>
