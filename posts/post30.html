            <h3>What is a Hackathon?</h3>
            <p>
                A <strong>hackathon</strong> is a sprint-like event where people come together to collaborate intensively, usually over 24-48 hours, to create functioning software or hardware prototypes, solve pressing problems, or bring forward new ideas. Whether you’re hosting for students, professionals, or hobbyists, a well-organized hackathon can become a hotbed for creativity, learning, and networking.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 1: Define Your Goals and Audience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>What’s your purpose?</strong> Are you aiming to develop new products, tackle social issues, or provide learning opportunities? Clarifying your objectives guides decisions on format, schedule, and judging.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identify your participants.</strong> Students? Professionals? A mix? Adjust technical difficulty, mentorship, and outreach accordingly.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Assemble a Team and Delegate Roles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Core organizing committee:</strong> Logistics, sponsorships, communications, tech support, marketing.</li>
                <li><strong>Volunteers:</strong> Day-of support, registration, food and troubleshooting.</li>
                <li><strong>Judges and mentors:</strong> Expert judges and mentors are crucial for feedback and guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Logistics and Planning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Venue & Virtual Options:</strong> Decide if it’s in-person, online, or hybrid. Ensure WiFi, power, desks, and accessibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Date & Duration:</strong> Typical hackathons run 24-48 hours. Avoid exam or holiday clashes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Registration:</strong> Use platforms like Eventbrite, Devfolio, or your own form. Gather team or solo sign-ups.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sponsorship:</strong> Approach companies or university departments for funds, swag, prizes, or platform credits.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Meals & Amenities:</strong> Don’t underestimate snacks, coffee, and midnight pizzas—energy fuel!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Health & Safety:</strong> Plan for 24/7 support, first aid, quiet rooms, and clear code of conduct.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Choose a Theme and Set Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                Thematic hackathons (e.g., <em>FinTech</em>, <em>HealthTech</em>, <em>Environment</em>) inspire focused creativity. Alternatively, open-ended formats let imagination soar. Consider providing sponsors’ challenges or unique datasets.
            </p>

            <h3>Step 5: Foster Collaboration and Community</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Kick off with an energetic opening ceremony and icebreaker.</li>
                <li>Offer ideation or team-building workshops.</li>
                <li>Set up a Slack/Discord channel for announcements and support.</li>
                <li>Encourage help-seeking and cross-team mingling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 6: Judging and Prizes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Judging rubrics:</strong> Should emphasize creativity, impact, technical execution, and presentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Demos & presentations:</strong> Give each team a fair time slot (3-5 minutes is common).</li>
                <li><strong>Prizes:</strong> Recognize overall winners, best design, impact, use of sponsor tech, or audience favorite.</li>
            </ul>
