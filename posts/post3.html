            <h2>Reducing bias in education evaluation trought improved assessment systems and methodologies</h2>
            <p>Date: November 20, 2024</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been growing concern about bias in higher education evaluation systems. This post explores how improved assessment methodologies can help reduce inequality and provide more accurate measures of student performance.</p>

            <p>One of the key debates in this area is the comparison between continuous assessment and standardized testing. Continuous assessment, which involves evaluating students throughout their learning process, is often seen as a more holistic approach. It may capture a broader range of skills and abilities, potentially better simulating the tasks students will have to performe outside class <sup>[1]</sup>  <sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

            <p>A meta-analysis by Black and Wiliam (1998) found that formative assessment practices, which are a form of continuous assessment, can have significant positive effects on student learning, particularly for low-achieving students<sup>[3]</sup>.</p> The continuous feed-back loops created by increasing the frequency of feedback that students receive may yeild substantial learning gains.

            <p>However, it's important to note that continuous assessment is not without its challenges. It can be more resource-intensive and potentially subject to different forms of bias, such as teacher favoritism or inconsistent grading standards across different educators or institutions.</p>

            <p>Some researchers propose a balanced approach. For example, Brookhart et al. (2016) suggest combining elements of both continuous and standardized assessment to create a more comprehensive and fair evaluation system<sup>[4]</sup>. This could involve using standardized tests as benchmarks while incorporating ongoing assessments to capture and foster student's growth and acess diverse sets of skills.</p>

            <p>Moving forward, it is clear that more research is needed to develop and validate assessment methodologies that can effectively reduce bias and promote equality in higher education. This may involve conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to rigorously test the effectiveness of new assessment methods, leveraging technology for more frequent, low-stakes assessments, or developing new types of evaluations that can capture a wider range of cognitive and non-cognitive skills<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>

            <p>As we continue to explore this topic, it's crucial to consider the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, including students, educators, administrators, and policymakers, to ensure that any new assessment systems are both effective and impartial<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup>.</p>
