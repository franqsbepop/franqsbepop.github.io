            <h2>Reducing Bias in education evaluation trought improved assessment systems and methodologies</h2>
            <p>Date: November 20, 2024</p>

            <p>In recent years, there has been growing concern about bias in higher education evaluation systems. This post explores how improved assessment methodologies can help reduce inequality and provide more accurate measures of student performance.</p>

            <p>One of the key debates in this area is the comparison between continuous assessment and standardized testing. Continuous assessment, which involves evaluating students throughout their learning process, is often seen as a more holistic approach. It can capture a broader range of skills and abilities, potentially reducing the bias inherent in single high-stakes exams.</p>

            <p>Robin Hanson, a prominent economist and social scientist, has contributed to this discussion. In his blog "Overcoming Bias", Hanson argues that continuous evaluation might better reflect real-world performance and reduce certain types of inequality<sup>[1]</sup>. He suggests that standardized tests, while efficient, may disproportionately favor students from certain backgrounds or those who excel at test-taking rather than subject mastery.</p>

            <p>Other researchers have also weighed in on this topic. For instance, a meta-analysis by Black and Wiliam (1998) found that formative assessment practices, which are a form of continuous assessment, can have significant positive effects on student learning, particularly for low-achieving students<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>

            <p>However, it's important to note that continuous assessment is not without its challenges. It can be more resource-intensive and potentially subject to different forms of bias, such as teacher favoritism or inconsistent grading standards across different educators or institutions.</p>

            <p>Some researchers propose a balanced approach. For example, Brookhart et al. (2016) suggest combining elements of both continuous and standardized assessment to create a more comprehensive and fair evaluation system<sup>[3]</sup>. This could involve using standardized tests as benchmarks while incorporating ongoing assessments to capture a student's growth and diverse skills.</p>

            <p>Moving forward, it's clear that more research is needed to develop and validate assessment methodologies that can effectively reduce bias and promote equality in higher education. This may involve leveraging technology for more frequent, low-stakes assessments, or developing new types of evaluations that can capture a wider range of cognitive and non-cognitive skills.</p>

            <p>As we continue to explore this topic, it's crucial to consider the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, including students, educators, administrators, and policymakers, to ensure that any new assessment systems are both effective and equitable.</p>
