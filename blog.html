                <h3>Learning via writing</h3>
                <p>Date: November 13, 2024</p>
                <p>Brief Recently I had to write this proposal. I found curious the concept of a proposal. I am proposing myself to do something. It is analagous to goal setting. Analgous to defining with loss-function, objective function. What will you be maximizing during the period of the proposal? Setting goal is a strenuous task. Firstly, you do not know where to start, so many possibilities, so many possible paths. The idea of a proposal should be to make both clear, hopefully by writing one you will be able to better understand firstly, what are your goals and secondly deliniate a path to avhieve them. It does not have to be the short-most-optimal path, at least not at this moment. Optomization surely must come leter, now we are just drawing a simple map. Once our loss (objetive) function is define we can start the optimization task, usually via parameter updating. There is a goal and a path to get there, how can you reach it in the most efficient manner? At this stage is where we start exploring our map in a virtual environment, in this case, our imagination, concepts such as gradient descent and local minima are certainly usefull to have in mind. Additionally, contrafactual thinking is a great tool we have at our disposal. What would happened if i perturbed my current path, i.e. shifted my parameters. One could see the path of alternative branches of the multiverse unfolding before their eyes. This is nothing new, just old techniques adapted to modern times. I believe that is all I have for now, I hope this helps with writing a proposal. Here is my proposal.</p>
