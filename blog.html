                <h2>Learning via writing</h2>
                <p>Date: November 13, 2024</p>
                <p>Recently I had to write this proposal. I find curious the concept of a proposal. I am (theoretically) proposing myself to do something. Carefully simulating planned experiences in my head prior to their (possible) unfloding in reality. Proposal writing seems analagous to goal setting, to define a loss (objective) function. What will be minimized (maximized) during the period of the proposal?</p> 
                <p>Setting goal is a strenuous task. Firstly, you do not know where to start, so many possible targets, so many possible paths. The idea of a proposal should be to make both clear. Hopefully, by writing one, you will be able to understand (quantify) your goals. Firstly, there is the need to properly define your goals, secondly, there is the need to crefully deliniate a possible path to achieve them. At this moment, it does not need to be the short-most-optimal path. Such optimization processes surely will be underwent at some point. Currently, we are drawing a simple map. Once our loss (objetive) function is defined, we can start the optimization task, usually via parameter updating. There is a set goal and a path to get there, how can you reach it in the most efficient manner?<p> 
                <p>At this stage, we start exploring our map in a virtual environment, in this case, our imagination. Concepts such as gradient descent and local minima are certainly useful to have in mind. Additionally, contrafactual thinking is a great tool we have at our disposal. What would happened if I perturbed my current path, i.e. shifted slighly my parameters. One can see the paths of alternative branches of the multiverse unfolding before ones' eyes. Nothing new, old techniques adapted to modern times. This is all I have for now, hope this helps, and hope you enjoy reading my proposal.</p>
