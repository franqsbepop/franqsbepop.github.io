                <h2>Learning via writing</h2>
                <p>Date: November 13, 2024</p>
                <p>Recently I had to write this proposal. I find curious the concept of a proposal. I am (theoretically) proposing myself to do something. Carefully simulating planned experiences in my head prior to their (possible) unfloding in reality. Proposal writing seems analagous to goal setting, to define a loss (objective) function. What will be minimized (maximized) during the period of the proposal?</p> 
                <p>Setting goal is a strenuous task. Firstly, you do not know where to start, so many possible targets, so many possible paths. The idea of a proposal should be to make both clear. Hopefully, by writing one, you will be able to understand (quantify) your goals. Firstly, there is the need to properly define your goals, secondly, there is the need to carefully deliniate a possible path to achieve them. At this moment, it does not need to be the shortest-most-optimal path. Such optimization processes surely will be underwent at some point. Currently, we are drawing a simple map. Once our loss (objetive) function is defined, we can start the optimization task, usually via parameter updating. There is a set goal and a path to get there, how can you reach it in the most efficient manner?<p> 
                <p>At this stage, we start exploring our map in a virtual environment, in this case, our imagination. Concepts such as gradient descent and local minima are certainly useful to have in mind. Additionally, contrafactual thinking is a great tool we have at our disposal. What would happened if I perturbed my current path, i.e. shifted slighly my parameters. One can see the paths of alternative branches of the multiverse unfolding before ones' eyes. Nothing new, old techniques adapted to modern times. This is all I have for now, hope this helps, and hope you enjoy reading my proposal.</p>

                <h2>The weak law of poorly abriviated large history</h2>
                <p>Date: November 25, 2024</p>
                <p>In this post I do my best to synthesize the hsitory of financial methematics in a short-piece. The post title is a spin on Stephan Hawkins a brief history of time. This (rather bries) history takes us back to the 1900 and the work of Bachilier, developed under the mentorship of Henry Pincar√©. The history is rather shortened mentioned named from attention grabbing puposes are Albert Einstein, Norbert Wiener, Volterra, Levy, Fisher Black, Myron Scholes, Robert Merton, X, Y, Emmanuel Derman, Paul Willmott, X, Y, Z. I hope you enjoy reading this rather short account of the field and some of the main characters that contributed in its development and dissemination. </p>

                <h2>Reducing Bias in education evaluation</h2>
                <p>Date: November 20, 2024</p>
                <p>In this post, I explore how improved assessment methodologies can help reduce inequality and provide more accurate measures of student performance. The post discusses the merits of continuous assessment versus standardized testing, drawing on research from prominent economists and education researchers. Key topics include formative assessment practices, the challenges of different evaluation methods, and proposals for balanced approaches that combine multiple assessment types. The discussion aims to contribute to developing more equitable and effective evaluation systems in higher education.</p>

                <h2>AI in Education</h2>
                <p>Date: October 5, 2024</p>
                <p>This post examines the integration of artificial intelligence and computational tools into education, exploring both opportunities and challenges. The discussion covers AI-powered educational tools, personalized learning experiences, automated assessment systems, and important considerations regarding human interaction, privacy, and equity in educational technology. The post emphasizes finding the right balance between technological innovation and traditional pedagogical approaches to create effective hybrid learning environments.</p>
